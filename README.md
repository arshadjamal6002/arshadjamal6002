# üí´ About Me:
Hey hey, what's up folks! <br><br>I'm Arshad, the machine learning aficionado with a passion for deep learning and a knack for creating intelligent machines that take over the world! Just kidding, I promise they're not that evil (yet). <br><br>Sophomore undergrad ai & ml researcher just for namesake and degree üéì! <br><br>I enjoy tinkering with deep learning frameworks, exploring new algorithms, and pondering the mysteries of the universe (seriously, what's the deal with quantum entanglement?!) <br><br>You can usually find me debugging my code at 3 AM white chugging down cups of coffee‚òï or playing BasketballüèÄ at the local community court. My neural networks may be artificial, but my love for them is real. <br><br>My codeüíª is always a work in progress, but I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting new projects. So let's join forces and build the smartest, sassiest bots this side of the internet! Oh, and if you're still using Python 2, we might have to have a chat..." <br><br>I'm a Vim fanatic[coz of Mr P], always up for a good debate on whether it's better than the likes of VS Code (which, let's be real, is just a fancy text editor). <br><br>If you're also into machine learning, deep learning, or just want to talk about all the cool stuff we can do with AI, hit me up and let's get this party started!üéâ <br><br>Oh, and don't let my cool exterior fool you, deep down I'm just a lost puppy trying to find my way in this crazy world of machine learning. But hey, aren't we all? <br><br>When I'm not busy coding, you can find me playing basketballüèÄ or exploring the latest memes on Reddit. I'm always up for a good laugh and a cup of coffee, so feel free to reach out and let's see what kind of trouble we can get into together!"<br>
